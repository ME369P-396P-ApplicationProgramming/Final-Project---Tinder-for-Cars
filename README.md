# Overview

You are looking for a new car and you have no idea what you want! Based on your location and budget, our application will help you find the perfect car. Our application scrapes car data from AutoTrader, and presents it in a "Tinder" fashioned manner. The application will present you with cars until enough information is gathered to conduct an analysis on your preferences. The user has the option to continue swipping to make a more precise analysis or get their best match after only five liked cars.
